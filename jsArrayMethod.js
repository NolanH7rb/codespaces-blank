// JavaScript Lists are called Arrays.

// JS Array is a data type for collecting and storing
// other data types, including other lists.

var grocery = ['apple' , 'milk', 'water'];

//An array can store
var generalist = [name1, grocery, 13232, 23.34, true];

//Array Methods
// A method is a function that works on a list (or object).
//methods are written after the list variable name and
//declard with a period.
// pretty much; the method is going inside of the list
// and running instructions on the data from the list.

console.log()
console.error()

// Push method() - this method (special function)
// adds a new piece of data to a list. It will add that
// new data to the back of the list.

generalist.push('new data')
console.log(generalist)

// Pop() method - This method removes a piece of data
//from a list. It will remove the last item in that list.

generallist.pop()
console.log(generallist

// Length() - This method counts the number of data
// inside of a list

console.log(generallist.length)
