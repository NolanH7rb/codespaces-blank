//1 One thing I found in the game that can help my game overall is the simple mechanic of the game and not having to overcomplicate movements within a non-3D game. Another thing i found in the game that can help my game is the moving background and how it's doesn't stand out to much.

//2 One thing that could help build my game is to allow the player who's playing the game to have full controll over the "flappy bird". Another thing is the ability to have the game endless and non-stop.
