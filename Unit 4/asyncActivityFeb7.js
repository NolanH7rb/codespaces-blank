"Question 3"
// Create a loop returning the highest grade in the list
//loop, function, number, interger, list, highest grade

//how many items in a list?
// how many grades do we need to check?

'1. Create a function'
'2. Need a loop to check a list of number (For loop)'
'3. Need to compare the grades to find highest'
'4. Need list of numbers (grades)'
'5. Need to make comparison between each number in the list'
'6. Need each loop to compare number to previous number'
'7. Need to carry over only the highest operator'

gradeList = ['77', '83', '55', '98', '67']

function gradeList() {

  let G = 0;

  for (G; G < gradeList.length; G++) {
    console.log(G)
  }
}
gradeList()
